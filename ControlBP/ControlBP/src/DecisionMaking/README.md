#Landmarks
## THANOS side
1. Start
2. U-turn
3. Beginning of ramp
4. Branch off at top of ramp (maybe also side tape, not sure if that's too far tbh) -> must turn left
5. Branch off along top and bottom 
IF WE GO TO LEFT (i.e. "bottom" loop)
6. Post on the left (POST 4, medium)
7. Post on the left (POST 3, short)
8. Post on the left (POST 2, short)
9. Post on the left (POST 1, medium)
IF WE GO TO FRONT / RIGHT (i.e. top of loop)
6. post on right (POST 5, tall)
7. post on right (POST 6, tall)
8. post on right (POST 1, medium)
9. post on right (POST 2)


## Thanos prelim strategy
POST 2 -> POST 3 -> POST 4 -> if time 5 (cross country?)
if collision at 2, go to 3
if collision near 3, go to 4
THEN we go to 5-6

if collision near 6-5: go back to 4

* assumption, no collision at POST 4
* if at any other point we collide
